            <h3>♡My fav coffee♡</h3>
            <p>Coffee comes in such different shapes and sizes. I think what makes coffee unique is that everyone has their own different preferences for it. Some like coffee extra strong and bitter, while some like it really sweet.</p>

            <p>My favorite coffee to make at home is a cold brew from
                starbucks. You can find these big jugs at walmart. Its great because its medium roast so its not too bitter. I love this coffee for a quick drink if I cannot go to dunkin.</p>
